Anyone who at any time has made or makes any payment to any party against promises of job or selection for a job with Deloitte or any matter related to this (including those for ‘registration’, ‘verification’ or ‘security deposit’) or otherwise engages with any such person who has made or makes fraudulent promises or offers, does so (or has done so) entirely at their own risk.

If you don't meet all of them, you just won't be a good fit on our team.

You must be a good team player.Atleast 5 year of work experience of which 3+ years of dedicated experience in data analysis, business intelligence, or business analytics. This means you've got some pretty top-notch analytical and quantitative skills and have proven your ability to use hard data and metrics to back up assumptions and develop business casesFamiliarity with SQL and Python. We're not worried about the dialects you know, just that you can write a query fluidly, cleanly, and quickly.Strong communication (verbal and written) and interpersonal skills to translate key insights from complex analyses into actionable business insights. You have to be able to speak data with people who don't speak data.In every respect, your personality reflect that of an amazing team member.You are the type of person who would feel bad about letting down your team.You should love playing with data.Lastly, and most importantly, you must be the type of person who works well on a team. (maybe you've seen a pattern here...)


What you're about to read is a very non-traditional job description. That's because this opening is for a very non-traditional team. This is the type of team people look back on and wish they could go back to after pursuing another position. The type of team that helps you get up out of bed in the morning because what they're working on is just stinkin' cool! With that note, if you're still interested, please keep reading. :)

We are looking for a stellar team member to join our FANTASTIC team of Business Analysts. Seriously... if you aren't going to be a stellar team member, you won't fit in with our group. The kind of person who we're looking for will be detail-oriented, enthusiastic, and determined. You might even be the type of person who reads data warehousing or analytics books in your free time, because you actually want to.



As a member of our team, you'll use Scrum to manage your day-to-day workload and will talk with team members around the world on a daily basis. You'll build (sustainable, scalable and automated) reports that help the organization act on information rather than just data. There's a 100% chance that you will work closely with operations leaders, product managers, SDEs, TPMs, data engineers, and senior management to define new metrics and project requirements which you will then take and create something awesome. You should be able to deal with ambiguity... sometimes, we don't have all the data, but we do need to act (as data people we, of course, would rather have all the data first, but life isn't always so kind to us data folks...).



In addition to these core responsibilities, you will also manage and execute analytical projects from start to finish including data gathering, manipulation, modeling, problem solving, and communication of insights and recommendations to senior management.

A successful candidate will be highly analytical. ""What does that even mean...?"" Well...



Analytical individuals want to gather a lot of facts, and they’re able to keep them organized when working on tasks and challenges. These thinkers bring a number of benefits to the team:

They have the ability to look at things in a holistic way.They base choices on realism and sound processes, with an underpinning of precision, accuracy, and detail. Their decisions have a great deal of validity.They are “walking dictionaries”! If you have a question, they likely know the answer – or know where to find the answer.They are strongly oriented towards policy and procedure.From a leadership perspective, they are highly organized and extremely knowledgeable about their work.
You really need to be experienced with SQL (and Python. That would be cool). You just do...

If all (or the vast majority) of these things apply to you, please keep reading!!

Normally, many of the items on this list are required qualifications. However, you might remember that you're not reading a normal job description, are you...

Proficiency in a statistical tool such as R, Stata, SAS, SPSS, and/or MinitabA degree (Bachelors, Masters, ect) in a quantitative field such as Mathematics, Statistics, Engineering, Computer Science, Economics, or a closely related field.Knowledge of AWS Infrastructure including S3, Redshift and RDSExperience with predictive modeling/machine learning.Python. :)",""

SCAM ALERT

Caution against fraudulent job offers!



We have been informed of instances where jobseekers are led to believe of fictitious job opportunities with Deloitte India (“Deloitte”). In one or more such cases, false promises of actual or potential selection, or initiation or completion of the recruitment formalities appear to have been or are being made. Some jobseekers appear to have been asked to pay money to specified bank accounts of individuals or entities as a condition of their selection for a ‘job’ with Deloitte. These individuals or entities are in no way connected with Deloitte and do not represent or otherwise act on behalf of Deloitte.



We would like to clarify that:

At Deloitte, ethics and integrity are fundamental and not negotiable.

We are against corruption and neither offer bribes nor accept them, nor induce or permit any other party to make or receive bribes on our behalf.

We have not authorised any party or person to collect any money from jobseekers in any form whatsoever for promises of getting jobs in Deloitte.

We consider candidates only on merit and that we provide an equal opportunity to eligible applicants.

No one other than an authorised official of Deloitte is permitted to confirm any job offer from Deloitte.

Anyone who at any time has made or makes any payment to any party against promises of job or selection for a job with Deloitte or any matter related to this (including those for ‘registration’, ‘verification’ or ‘security deposit’) or otherwise engages with any such person who has made or makes fraudulent promises or offers, does so (or has done so) entirely at their own risk. Deloitte takes no responsibility or liability for any such unauthorised or fraudulent actions or engagements.

We encourage jobseekers to exercise caution. If you have queries about the veracity of a job offer you have received which relates to Deloitte or would like to report a fraud with regard to job offers with Deloitte, please send an email to inhiringalert@deloitte.com

With Atlan, we have already seen some early signs of Product-Market Fit. Our users tell us things like, ""Your product is saving me two hours a day! Now with the extra time, I'm upskilling myself by learning Python!""


At this stage, we have started engaging with selected data teams of leading companies in 3-6 month pilots. We work in a collaborative fashion with these leading analytics and business teams to ensure they build solutions that create a competitive business advantage using our product. We are looking for an account manager who can understand both business and data to work closely with our pilot customers to ensure that they get exponential value from our product.


This is a role for someone yearning for an entrepreneurial opportunity to work closely in a small team of engineers, data scientists and business folks to take a visionary product and make it a market leader!
What will you do?
You will be the face of engagements with new Atlan customers & partnerships.
You will own the metric of driving value for customers, user and customer satisfaction and annual revenue subscriptions for the business: your ultimate KPI is converting pilot clients into annual subscription customers.
You will work closely with the business, analytics and engineering stakeholders in the client organization, and be an expert on our data platform and product.
You will enable Atlan customers to understand the different contexts in which the Atlan product can be effectively used and conceptualize new use-cases and solutions.
You will be building strong relationships with stakeholders inside the organizations - CIO, CDO functions and business counterparts using Atlan to build data products/use cases from functions like finance, sales, operations, people analytics etc.
You will proactively empower the customer to identify problems in their current internal data systems, question the status quo, build relevant use cases and ultimately aid into the growth of their business with the help of their internal data.
You will work closely with our product team (engineers, product specialists, marketers) to incorporate client feedback into the product roadmap to ensure continued client success.
What makes you a great match for us?
Solid business understanding and functional knowledge, including but not limited to strategy, business development, marketing and sales, etc.
You can easily build an understanding of technical concepts.
You have impeccable communication skills and the ability to communicate complex ideas effectively. Strong listening skills are key to success in this role.
You have strong stakeholder management skills and experience in handling complex multi-stakeholder projects and accounts.
You have experience with data analytics/management consulting, data warehousing.
You have an interest in the businesses of the organizations— the end value of the product is shown only when the business of the organizations is benefited and it sees some value.
You have an understanding of the cloud ecosystem and the relevant technologies in the data space— the person has to keep themselves updated on the trends in the data ecosystem.
You believe in value-based adoption of products and can ensure the successful conversion of pilot accounts to long-term customer value.

We are one of the leaders in Software as a Service in the world of business applications. This is an exciting time to join Dynamics CRM - we are innovating and rethinking CRM. We are focusing on the capabilities next generation business productivity software needs to provide in a mobile and cloud first world. We aim to build the best-in-class cloud application on Azure and are looking for experienced engineers to help us design the next version of our online service and lead Microsoft’s charge against salesforce.com. This is a great opportunity to work on something highly strategic to Microsoft. The Data Services Team is at the center of the CRM platform and provides frameworks to model, manage, and access CRM data. The team is focused on three primary charters: Data Modeling and Solutions: We provide many capabilities for modeling data, and we manage the core platform that use these metadata to drive data operations. But new CRM applications demand a more diverse set of data modeling capabilities that we need to support, such as geo-spatial fields for mobile clients or new relationship types or even virtual data stored in external systems. These data models, along with the business process and UI constructs, can be packaged into “solutions” or “apps” that utilize CRM as a platform and expand its capabilities for different customer needs. We want to build a marketplace that allows partners to produce solutions that can customers can purchase and license via O365, which requires significant infrastructure investments in how we install, entitle, and update these solutions at scale for our Online and On-Premise businesses. Search: The success of a CRM system depends heavily on being able to find customer data, be it to provide customer service or to make inferences about possible marketing opportunities. We are building an integration with Azure Search to leverage its rich search capabilities, enabling a fast, relevance-based search experience from multiple devices. We ultimately plan to expand our initial offering to support faceting and filtering, along with other scenarios such as Open Search, Bing at Work, and even richer Cortana integration. Extended Data Platform: More and more customer scenarios, such as business analytics, reporting, and even machine learning, require CRM data to be available to different back-end systems. Additionally, many data integration scenarios such as Exchange Integration or mobile push notifications require a way to know what data have changed in CRM in order to propagate those changes to other systems. We are building a Data Sync Framework and an Extended Data Platform to solve these data sync and notification scenarios. Our challenge is not only to build these capabilities but to do so in a way that’s scalable, performant, highly-available, and secure. In order to meet these demands we’ve expanded our use of Azure to solve these problems. For example, the Extended Data Platform is built in Azure and uses the Service Fabric “Actor” model heavily. We will continue to evaluate new technologies in the Azure ecosystem, be it for storage or compute, that can allow us to meet our functional, performance, and security goals for the features that we build. The team consists of highly motivated, innovative, customer focused engineers and engineering leaders. We have optimized our engineering for the cloud with a fast cadence of releases, delivering innovation at an exciting pace. Our team works in an agile environment where we expect each team member to think out of the box to contribute and collaborate towards the mission of the team in a feature-crew setting. As part of this team, you will get exciting opportunities to work on cutting edge technologies across a variety of platforms, building the next generation of Dynamics CRM and revolutionizing the way businesses operates.
Responsibilities
We are looking for a passionate and motivated senior level developer to be a technical leader in design and implementation for cloud platform capabilities in Dynamics CRM, leveraging Office365 and Azure. These capabilities must not only provide the foundation for new user experiences and complex business process definitions, they must also scale out to support active usage around the world by hundreds of thousands of customers 24x7. You will be expected to work collaboratively within the team and provide technical oversight to feature crews, work through competing priorities, and solve complex technical challenges to meet business goals and maintain live site availability.
QualificationsBachelor’s or Master’s degree in Computer Science.8+ years of experience in software development (MS Azure, C#, ASP.NET, REST, SQL)4+ years of experience developing large scale online services / applications that are secure and have robust performance and reliability4+ years of experience with Agile development methodologies and unit testing practicesA passion for improving engineering practices and producing high quality software
Solid CS fundamentals and strong inclination for architecting at scale
Excellent technical design, problem solving and debugging skills
Good written and oral communication skills

Organised service commerce is a large yet young industry in India. While India is a very large market for home and local services (~USD 50 Billion in retail spends) and expected to double in the next 5 years, there is no billion-dollar company in this segment today. The industry is barely ~20 years old, with a sub-optimal market architecture typical of an unorganised market – fragmented supply side operated by middlemen. As a result, experiences are broken for both customers and service professionals, each largely relying upon word of mouth to discover the other. The industry can easily be 1.5-2x larger than it is today, if the frictions in user and professional’s journeys are removed – and the experiences made more meaningful and joyful.
UrbanClap is a “services platform”, with the bold ambition to organize the key verticals within the service commerce industry, bringing in the benefits of scale - structured processes, systems, standardisation, transparency and trust. This platform will enable billions of dollars in commerce annually, and create jobs for 1 million+ service professionals. The key industries that we are going to organize over the next few years include – home improvement, home maintenance & repairs, appliance repairs, salon spa & makeup services, fitness & health at home, academic tuitions, photography & events, packing & moving etc.
Job Responsibilities
End-to-end ownership of select service categories
Solve for structural problems at a central level to speed up the growth of the category
Own analytical projects to solve for different types of business problems
Enable on-boarding of great service professionals in the category
Institutionalize service delivery norms and set centralized processes for the category
Collaborate with cross-functional internal partners in marketing, technology and product to execute multiple category and central level projects
Work with the marketing team to generate customer requests and improve demand
Job Requirements
2 + years of work-experience in startups, consulting, or operations roles
Strong analytical skills and a data driven decision making mentality. Knowledge of SQL and prior experience in business analytics preferred
Strong oral and written communication skills
Hustle and get things done attitude
College – DU/NIITs/etc. preferred.",""

SCAM ALERT

Caution against fraudulent job offers!



We have been informed of instances where jobseekers are led to believe of fictitious job opportunities with Deloitte India (“Deloitte”). In one or more such cases, false promises of actual or potential selection, or initiation or completion of the recruitment formalities appear to have been or are being made. Some jobseekers appear to have been asked to pay money to specified bank accounts of individuals or entities as a condition of their selection for a ‘job’ with Deloitte. These individuals or entities are in no way connected with Deloitte and do not represent or otherwise act on behalf of Deloitte.



We would like to clarify that:

At Deloitte, ethics and integrity are fundamental and not negotiable.

We are against corruption and neither offer bribes nor accept them, nor induce or permit any other party to make or receive bribes on our behalf.

We have not authorised any party or person to collect any money from jobseekers in any form whatsoever for promises of getting jobs in Deloitte.

We consider candidates only on merit and that we provide an equal opportunity to eligible applicants.

No one other than an authorised official of Deloitte is permitted to confirm any job offer from Deloitte.

Anyone who at any time has made or makes any payment to any party against promises of job or selection for a job with Deloitte or any matter related to this (including those for ‘registration’, ‘verification’ or ‘security deposit’) or otherwise engages with any such person who has made or makes fraudulent promises or offers, does so (or has done so) entirely at their own risk. Deloitte takes no responsibility or liability for any such unauthorised or fraudulent actions or engagements.

We encourage jobseekers to exercise caution. If you have queries about the veracity of a job offer you have received which relates to Deloitte or would like to report a fraud with regard to job offers with Deloitte, please send an email to inhiringalert@deloitte.com

Working at Consilium Software
We asked our people what they love about working with Consilium Software. They said they liked working for a company that is big enough to be a force on the global stage, yet small enough for one person to make a difference. You are not just a number or a name on an org chart. We feel every employee can make a difference and be part of collaborating to build products that are trusted by Fortune-list customers and governments. That’s what we are always trying to deliver as a culture for the team. Having the ability to make a visible difference comes with a high level of responsibility, and we understand that not everyone gets excited about that. In our interviews we make sure you find out what we are and what we are not, to ensure that Consilium is just as good a fit for you, as you are for Consilium!
