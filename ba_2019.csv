If you don't meet all of them, you just won't be a good fit on our team.You must be a good team player.Atleast 5 year of work experience of which 3+ years of dedicated experience in data analysis, business intelligence, or business analytics. This means you've got some pretty top-notch analytical and quantitative skills and have proven your ability to use hard data and metrics to back up assumptions and develop business casesFamiliarity with SQL and Python. We're not worried about the dialects you know, just that you can write a query fluidly, cleanly, and quickly.Strong communication (verbal and written) and interpersonal skills to translate key insights from complex analyses into actionable business insights. You have to be able to speak data with people who don't speak data.In every respect, your personality reflect that of an amazing team member.You are the type of person who would feel bad about letting down your team.You should love playing with data.Lastly, and most importantly, you must be the type of person who works well on a team.

What you're about to read is a very non-traditional job description. That's because this opening is for a very non-traditional team. This is the type of team people look back on and wish they could go back to after pursuing another position.

We are looking for a stellar team member to join our FANTASTIC team of Business Analysts. Seriously... if you aren't going to be a stellar team member, you won't fit in with our group.

This means you've got some pretty top-notch analytical and quantitative skills and have proven your ability to use hard data and metrics to back up assumptions and develop business casesFamiliarity with SQL and Python. We're not worried about the dialects you know, just that you can write a query fluidly, cleanly, and quickly.Strong communication (verbal and written) and interpersonal skills to translate key insights from complex analyses into actionable business insights. You have to be able to speak data with people who don't speak data.In every respect, your personality reflect that of an amazing team member.You are the type of person who would feel bad about letting down your team.You should love playing with data.Lastly, and most importantly, you must be the type of person who works well on a team. (maybe you've seen a pattern here...)
What you're about to read is a very non-traditional job description. That's because this opening is for a very non-traditional team. This is the type of team people look back on and wish they could go back to after pursuing another position. The type of team that helps you get up out of bed in the morning because what they're working on is just stinkin' cool! With that note, if you're still interested, please keep reading. :)
We are looking for a stellar team member to join our FANTASTIC team of Business Analysts. Seriously... if you aren't going to be a stellar team member, you won't fit in with our group.
